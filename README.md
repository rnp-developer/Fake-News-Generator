# 📰 Fake News Generator (Python)

The **Fake News Generator** is a funny Python-based console application that generates completely random and hilarious fake headlines. Each headline features a person, action, location, and emoji reaction — plus a timestamp. It also automatically saves all generated news into a `.txt` file!
